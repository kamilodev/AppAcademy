## üìÑ Description

<p align="justify">
AppAcademy is a comprehensive Management Solution for Dance Schools. Our mission is to provide a modern and efficient solution to dance schools, allowing them to manage all aspects related to their students, teachers, classes and registrations in an agile and organized manner.</p>

<p align="justify">
This project focuses on a backend solution, through the implementation of a database capable of managing the registrations of new students, teachers, classes, discounts, and dance sessions. The project is loaded with some example data that you can initialize to see how it works, or skip it and enter the information you consider necessary.

<p style="color: #576E9D">Rename the .env.example file to .env and edit the environment variables with the actual data of your local or remote MySQL database connection.</p>

<p style="color: #576E9D">The variable named MYSQL_ADDON_DB is the name of the database you will use for the project, set the name equal to the name that appears in lines 1 and 2 of the app_academy_db.sql file. If you do not want to change the default name which is app_academy_db, set this variable with this name.</p>

<p style="color: #576E9D">Open your Database Manager and connect to a local or remote server. At this point you don't need to have the database created, just test the connection and it is correct, note that the database field is empty for now.</p>
